		<h1>About the Project</h1>
		<section>
			<h2><strong>The Problem</strong></h2> 
				<p>Projects for the good of a community require significant planning and coordination to achieve. It is also difficult to find and advertise these projects to interested parties, and even harder to recruit new volunteers for the first time.</p>
				<p> We are creating a space where active community members can start and find projects, while simultaneously advocating for and recruiting new volunteers. Our goal is to solve the lack of dedicated online spaces for community-led, funded, and staffed physical projects.</p>
				<p>The internet has contributed to a global issue of retracting from in-person activities, making the improvement of social infrastructure in communities a necessity. Communal Grounds provides a space to foster more resilient, collaborative, and engaged communities, which has a significant positive global impact.</p>
			<h2><strong>SDG Goals</strong></h2>
				<p>The main Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) we are targeting is SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities. By promoting a strong community willing to help one another, other SDGs such as 6, 9, and 13 may also be indirectly targeted, depending on the community's chosen projects.</p>

			<h2>Users</h2>
				<p>Our target users include current community organizers, local organizations, and new, potential volunteers. Organizers and organizations gain essential tools for project management and volunteer recruitment. New volunteers benefit from a platform that simplifies finding and joining community projects, lowering the barrier to entry.</p>
				<p>The platform is designed to benefit a diverse group, including project hosts, all volunteers, and the wider community impacted by the completed projects. The potential user base is the entirety of the community interested in projects, including those with no prior experience.</p>
			<h2>The Solution</h2>
				<p><b>Communal Grounds</b> is a web application that acts as a central platform for end-to-end management of communal work projects. It provides tools for project management, volunteer recruitment, and facilitates all necessary planning and communication within the website itself.</p>
			<p>Communal Grounds differentiates itself from existing platforms in the following ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Unlike similar 'listings apps' the entire planning and communication process can be managed on Communal Grounds.</li>
					<li>The core focus on community-building and not solely a project management tool or social hub puts Communal Grounds apart from other 'communication apps.'</li>
					<li>Communal Grounds is free to use for all members, is community-managed, allows regular users to post projects, and projects are dynamic rather than static, unlike other 'community project apps.</li>
				</ul>
