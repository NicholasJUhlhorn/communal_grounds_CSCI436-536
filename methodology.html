		<h1>Research Methodology</h1>
		<section>
			<h2>Systematic Literature Review</h2>
			<p>We conducted a systematic literature review to better understand the problem space of community engagement and participation. We reviewed the following papers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TPC.2025.3530783">The City Residents Do Not Get Involved: Understanding Barriers to Community Participation in a Small Texas Boomtown</a></li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3708359.3712118">Coalesce: An Accessible Mixed-Initiative System for Designing Community-Centric Questionnaires</a></li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4639178">Following the evolution of distributed Communities of Practice</a></li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9955198">User Role Discovery Method in Virtual Community Based on DBSCAN Clustering</a></li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8629583/">Humanitarian Application of Science and Technology</a></li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7058192">Human Smart Cities: A Human-centric model aiming at the wellbeing and quality of life of citizens</a></li>
			</ul>

			<p>These papers helped us each individually create our initial designs for Communal Grounds. We then combined our ideas together into a first prototype mockup of the site. <a href="#prototypes">See the prototype images.</a></p>

			<h2>System Analysis</h2>
			<p>We analyzed <b>nine</b> existing systems and platforms to identify their strengths and weaknesses in relation to our goals. The systems analyzed included: <b>Reddit, Discord, Volunteero, Mobilize, Craigslist, Idealist - VolunteerMatch, Discourse, Circle, and Slack.</b></p>
			<p>Our analysis revealed that current solutions either lacked a community-building aspect, were too restrictive or static, or failed to provide a complete, non-political platform for in-app planning and communication. This confirmed the need for Communal Grounds as a dedicated, free, community-managed, and comprehensive solution.</p>
			<p>Using our findings we refined our prototype each individually again. Once we had our extended prototypes we once again combined them all into a single prototype.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>User Study</h2>
			<p>We conducted in-depth user interviews to validate our initial design ideas and identify key user needs. We also had our participants engage in co-designs with us to illuminate solutions or ideas we may have overlooked while building out our prototypes.</p>
			<p>Findings from the interviews include:
				<ul>
					<li>The ability for organizers to query a "volunteer pool" for short-notice work based on availability and location.</li>
					<li>Expanded communication channels, such as a wiki-style format for project pages with specialized channels for updates.</li>
					<li>A system for work delegation and explicit role assignment (job titles) to ensure clear responsibilities within a project.</li>
					<li>It's important to make our solution unique and valuable enough to where users won't feel like they're adding bloat to their routine
					</li>
					<li>Make dates easily viewable in order to help with organization and routine.
					</li>
					<li>Add polls in order to give users more input (this was something the interviewee's existing tech option already had and I personally liked it and felt like it fit our solution)
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>We then followed our usual steps to create refined prototypes then combine them all into our final prototype; from which we started building out Communal Grounds.</p>
