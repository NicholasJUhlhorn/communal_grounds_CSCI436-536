            <p>Communal Grounds is a volunteer organization web application built with Flask. Its core functionality focuses on managing community projects and the people that work on them.</p>
            <h3>Key Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>User Management:</b> The platform tracks user state, allows sign-up with passwords, and enables current users to edit their profiles and manage a friend list.</li>
                <li><b>Project Organization:</b> Projects are displayed on the home page and users can apply to join a project, allowing hosts to handpick members for better security and fit.</li>
                <li><b>Detailed Profiles:</b> User profiles show active projects and participation percentages to promote active participation.</li>
                <li><b>Project Communication & Delegation:</b> Each project has a central hub. Project owners can assign specific roles or job titles to users to clearly define responsibilities and tasks for effective work delegation.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <p>The Communal Grounds application is built on a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Database:</b> The application uses a SQLite DB to store all platform data, including tables for Users, Projects, Project Members, and Reactions.</li>
                <li><b>Backend Framework:</b> Python and a framework like Flask are used for the Controller and Model layers. This includes logic for handling user input, managing session state, and interacting with the database.</li>
                <li><b>Web Technology:</b> Standard HTML, CSS (for style and feel), and dynamic routing are used for the View and presentation layer.</li>
            </ul>
